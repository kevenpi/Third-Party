  "overallInsight": "This 10-minute conversation about spring break plans produced a distinctive slow-burn stress pattern. Unlike the sharp spikes in your conversation with Arthur, stress here built gradually and steadily - HR climbing from 64 to 88 bpm (a 37% increase) and HRV sliding from 50ms to 34ms (a 32% decrease) over the full duration without any single dramatic trigger. Stress rose from 18 to a peak of 55. The critical moments came at 5:00 when your accommodation language (saying 'whatever you want') pushed stress from 38 to 43 - your body registering the cost of self-silencing - and at 8:00 when Jessica directly asked for your real opinion and your stress still climbed to 54 rather than releasing. This pattern suggests that quiet emotional withdrawal is more physiologically taxing for you than open conflict. Your body took 6 minutes to begin recovering after the conversation ended, and the slow-burn nature of the activation means recovery takes longer because there was no single peak for your nervous system to process and release."
