  "overallInsight": "This brief 5-minute check-in was a quiet but meaningful repair moment. Your HR stayed within a narrow 68-74 bpm range and HRV held between 42-45ms throughout - a remarkably flat profile compared to the sharp escalation pattern in your earlier conversation with Arthur. Stress never exceeded 28, compared to the peak of 78 from earlier in the day. The most telling moment was Arthur's apology at 1:00, which triggered an immediate 2 bpm HR dip and slight HRV recovery. Your body trusted the repair. When you set a boundary at 3:00 saying you need more time, your HR barely moved - suggesting you felt safe enough with Arthur to express a need without activating a defensive response. This conversation did not fully resolve the earlier tension (your baseline of 70 bpm was still elevated above your morning 66), but it moved the needle in the right direction."
