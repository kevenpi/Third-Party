You said you had a long day too and that you felt like nothing you do is enough. I heard myself say you never listen to what I need. We both got louder for a minute. Then we paused and you said you wanted to understand what I was really asking for. I said I needed ten minutes of help before dinner so I could calm down. You said that sounded fair and apologized for shutting down. I apologized for accusing you and thanked you for helping. We ended by agreeing to check in before chores tomorrow.",

Your capacity to move from accusation to specific needs, and from defensiveness to accountability, suggests strong underlying connection and communication skills."
